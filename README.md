## Description

Contact Keeper is a full-stack MERN application with CRUD functionality for keeping track of contact details. I built this App as part of a [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) on Udemy. 
 
During this project I learnt:

- How to use and implement the useContext hook.
- How to use and implement the useReducer hook.
- Form validation.
- OAuth using JWT.
- How to create private routes.
- How to encrypt passwords using bcrypt.
- Error handling.
